🎯 **Project Objective:**
Built an end-to-end customer analytics platform that predicts customer behavior, segments audiences, and quantifies business impact using advanced machine learning and interactive visualization.

🔍 **What I Built:**
• **Customer Segmentation Models** using K-means clustering and RFM analysis  
• **Churn Prediction Models** with 87.3% accuracy (Random Forest)  
• **Customer Lifetime Value** modeling with 73.4% prediction accuracy  
• **3 Interactive Tableau Dashboards** for executive decision-making  
• **Complete Analytics Pipeline** from BigQuery to business insights  

🏆 **Key Achievements:**
• **87.3% churn prediction accuracy** using Random Forest (exceeds benchmarks)  
• **R4.8M+ annual revenue potential** identified through customer analytics  
• **4 strategic customer segments** with actionable business recommendations  
• **656% ROI potential** demonstrated for analytics implementation  
• **44,000+ customer records** analyzed across 6 integrated datasets  

⚡ **Business Impact:**
• **Premium Loyalists (25%):** 8-12% revenue growth opportunity through VIP programs  
• **Digital Natives (30%):** 23-31% growth via mobile experience optimization  
• **Occasional Shoppers (28%):** 15-22% growth through engagement campaigns  
• **At-Risk High-Spenders (17%):** Critical retention intervention preventing revenue loss
